<!-- This mapping demonstrates (1) use of a class-to-subselect mapping, that allows data defined in other classes to be exposed as a read-only entity (you would do this if you really wanted a view, but didn't or couldn't define one for some reason) This is a "derived entity" mapping. (2) use of <synchronize/> to ensure that auto-flush happens correctly, and that queries against the derived entity do not return stale data -->
